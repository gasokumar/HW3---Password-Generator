# HW3---Password-Generator

Edited the javascript for a password generator. Made a generator that, once the button was clicked, would prompt the user for a series of password criteria that would then be used to generate a password for the user.

The password generator intakes a series of criteria and gives the user a password based on their inputs:

The generator asks for a length between 8-128 characters, and whether the user wants uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers included in their password.

The inputs are all validated and when all prompots are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
